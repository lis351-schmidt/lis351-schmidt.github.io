### Specifications and Descriptions of the Trains

- **SNCF TGV POS**  
  The record-setting trainset was a tuned version of the TGV POS and was built with 2 power cars plus 3 passenger rail cars, different from its usual 8-10 rail cars. No conventional wheeled train has beaten this speed record.

- **CRH380BL**  
  One of the few unmodified trains to break a record. It achieved its speed during normal service using its 16-car trainset and is the current record holder for the top speed of an unmodified production vehicle.

- **Class 955 Shinkansen**  
  This prototype train, also called the 300X, was designed to test features and technology that would later be incorporated into newer Shinkansen trains.

- **Hyundai Rotem HEMU-430X**  
  A 6-car trainset that achieved its record during a maximum speed test. It entered service in South Korea from 2020 to 2021 as the EMU-320.

- **Siemens Velaro E/Ave S-103**  
  An unmodified train that set the record in 2006, holding it until 2010. This 8-car trainset shares similarities with Germany’s ICE 3 and is part of Siemens' Velaro Family.

- **ICE 3/DB BR 406**  
  Another unmodified train that set its record in 2001 during an approval run. This type of InterCity Express was developed for international routes.

- **ETR 500 "Frecciarossa"**  
  The name "Frecciarossa" (red arrow) reflects its red color. The 2009 record was achieved in the Monte Bibele tunnel with a test trainset of 2 power cars and 8 passenger cars.

- **Siemens EuroSprinter**  
  This locomotive, not part of a high-speed trainset, set its record while pulling one railcar. It holds the record for the maximum speed of an unmodified electric locomotive.

- **BR Class 373/Eurostar e300**  
  This unmodified train reached its record speed on the High Speed 1 line near Nashenden Valley during routine service. It’s the longest train to set a record with 2 power cars and 18 passenger cars.

- **Class 1000 Shinkansen/Type-O**  
  The prototype for Japan’s first high-speed train achieved its record on a test track, later becoming the Type-O Shinkansen used in 1964.
