        <p>There have been multiple attempts by countless manufacturers and countries to build the fastest train in history. However, this list only comprises the most notable ones to date since the creation of the "high-speed train" with conventional wheels.</p>

        <p style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Here are the most notable record attempts (in order of top speed):</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>SNCF TGV POS</b> - Top Speed: 574.8 km/h (357 mph), France (2007)</li>
            <li><b>CRH380BL</b> - Top Speed: 487.3 km/h (303 mph), China (2010)</li>
            <li><b>Class 955 Shinkansen</b> - Top Speed: 443.0 km/h (275 mph), Japan (1996)</li>
            <li><b>Hyundai Rotem HEMU-430X</b> - Top Speed: 421.4 km/h (262 mph), South Korea (2013)</li>
            <li><b>Siemens Velaro E/Ave S-103</b> - Top Speed: 403 km/h (251 mph), Spain (2006)</li>
            <li><b>ICE 3/DB BR 406</b> - Top Speed: 368.4 km/h (229 mph), Germany (2001)</li>
            <li><b>ETR 500 Frecciarossa</b> - Top Speed: 362 km/h (225 mph), Italy (2009)</li>
            <li><b>Siemens EuroSprinter</b> - Top Speed: 357 km/h (222 mph), Germany (2006)</li>
            <li><b>BR Class 373/Eurostar e300</b> - Top Speed: 334.7 km/h (208 mph), United Kingdom (2003)</li>
            <li><b>Class 1000 Shinkansen/Type-O</b> - Top Speed: 286 km/h (178 mph), Japan (1972)</li>
        </ol>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Specifications and descriptions of the trains:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>SNCF TGV POS</dt>
            <dd>The record-setting trainset was a tuned version of the TGV POS, built with 2 power cars and 3 passenger cars instead of its usual 8-10. No conventional wheeled train has beaten this speed record.</dd>
            <dt>CRH380BL</dt>
            <dd>One of the few unmodified trains to break a record. This train achieved its record during normal service using its 16-car trainset and holds the record for the top speed of an unmodified production vehicle.</dd>
            <dt>Class 955 Shinkansen</dt>
            <dd>Also known as the "300X," this was a prototype train used to test features and technology later incorporated into newer Shinkansen models.</dd>
            <dt>Hyundai Rotem HEMU-430X</dt>
            <dd>A 6-car trainset that achieved its record during maximum speed tests. It entered service in South Korea between 2020-2021 under the official name "EMU-320."</dd>
            <dt>Siemens Velaro E/Ave S-103</dt>
            <dd>An unmodified train that set its record in 2006 using its standard 8-car trainset. It shares similarities with Germany's ICE 3 train as part of Siemens' Velaro family.</dd>
            <dt>ICE 3/DB BR 406</dt>
            <dd>This type of InterCity Express (ICE) train was developed for international routes. It achieved its record during an approval run, reaching 10% higher speeds than its approved limit.</dd>
            <dt>ETR 500 Frecciarossa</dt>
            <dd>The Italian name "Frecciarossa" means "Red Arrow," reflecting its color. The record-setting test model achieved its speed in the Monte Bibele tunnel. The trainset had 2 power cars and 8 passenger cars compared to the current 11-car setup.</dd>
            <dt>Siemens EuroSprinter</dt>
            <dd>The only locomotive on this list, the EuroSprinter ES64U set the record while pulling a single railcar. It holds the record for the maximum speed of an unmodified electric locomotive.</dd>
            <dt>BR Class 373/Eurostar e300</dt>
            <dd>This train achieved its record during routine service, using its 2 power cars and 18 passenger cars. It remains the longest train to set a record.</dd>
            <dt>Class 1000 Shinkansen/Type-O</dt>
            <dd>The prototype for the later Type-O Shinkansen, the Class 1000 was the very first true "High-Speed Train," achieving its record on a test track now part of the Tohoku Shinkansen line.</dd>
