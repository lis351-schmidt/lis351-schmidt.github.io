        <b><p>Specifications and descriptions of the trains:</p></b>
        <dl>
            <dt>SNCF TGV POS</dt>
            <dd>The record setting trainset was a tuned version of the TGV POS and was built up of 2 power cars plus 3 passenger rail cars. Different from its usual 8-10 rail cars. No conventional wheeled train has beaten this speed record.</dd>
            <dt>CRH380BL</dt>
            <dd>One of the few unmodded trains to break a record. It was during normal service using its 16 car trainset and is the current record holder for the top speed of an unmodified production vehicle.</dd>
            <dt>Class 966 Shinkansen</dt>
            <dd>This was a prototype train also called the 300X. The purpose of the 300X was to text features and technology that would be later incorporated with other newer shinkansen trains in the future.</dd>
            <dt>Hyundai Rotem HEMU-430X</dt>
            <dd>This was a 6 car trainset that achieved its record during a maximum speed test. It is now in service in South Korea delivered from 2020-2021 with its official name of the EMU-320.</dd>
            <dt>Siemens Velaro E/Ave S-103</dt>
            <dd>This was also an unmodified train that set the record in 2006. It held the record until 2010 when the CRH380BL took it. This was a typical trainset of 8 cars. This train shares similarities with Germany's ICE 3 train as its the 2nd member of Siemen's Velaro Family of trains (Siemens being the manufacturer).</dd>
            <dt>ICE 3/DB BR 406</dt>
            <dd>This was another one of the unmodified trains to set the speed record up until 2006 (taken by the Siemens Velaro E/Ave S-103). This specific type of InterCity Express (ICE) train, BR 406, was developed to operate international routes and achieved its record duing an approval run where it had to reach 10% higher than what its approved speed was.</dd>
            <dt>ETR 500 "Frecciarossa"</dt>
            <dd>The Italian name "Frecciarossa" means red arrow, mirroring its red color of current trains. The model that set the record in 2009 was a test model. It is important to note that this record was considered an "indoor" record as the speed achieved by this train was done in the Monte Bibele tunnel. This trainset was slightly shorter comprised of 2 power cars and 8 passenger cars compared to its current 11 passenger cars.</dd>
            <dt>Siemens EuroSprinter</dt>
            <dd>This is the only train on this list that wasn't part of a high speed trainset. The record was set by the EuroSprinter ES64U, the universal varient of the locomotive, operated by OBB, an Austrian rail operator. These trains have been exported all over the world to do a variety of jobs like haul passenger services and freight. On this day, the locomotive set the record while pulling one railcar behind it and holds the record for the maximum speed of an electric locomotive, unmodded.</dd>
            <dt>BR Class 373/Eurostar e300</dt>
            <dd>This was also an unmodded train as it was done during a routine service. The speed was recorded near Nashenden Valley on the High Speed 1 line. What makes it more impressive is this is also the longest train to set a record as the trainset is comprised of 2 power cars and 18 passenger cars. Its official name is the Eurostar e300 to follow the naming convention of its predecessor, the Eurostar e320. The BR Class 373 name is the naming convention of British trains. BR standing for British Class.</dd>
            <dt>Class 1000 Shinkansen/Type-O</dt>
            <dd>The Class 1000 Shinkansen was the very first true "High Speed Train". The prototype achieved its speed record on a test track that is now a part of the Tohoku Shinkansen line. This train was the prototype of the later built Type-O Shinkansen that entered service in 1964.</dd>
